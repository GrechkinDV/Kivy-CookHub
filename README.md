# Kivy-CookHub
Application was made as the ***successful Bachelor Graduate Work***.
The absolute idea of this project was to ease life. Hundreds of recipes together with ingredients(stored in memory as __sqlite3__ format) are able to ease cook life of each person.

As the first step, user has to fill information into __Virtual Fridge__ - the list of possessed ingredients. 
Then after searching for recipes(the search can be done by name, tag or ingredient) and adding inspiring meal to __Favourites__, (s)he is able to get automatically generated list of missing ingredients.
